# Home-Office-Post-Full-Stack-Application
Home Office Post is project that I created using HTML/CSS/JavaScript on the front end and NodeJs with a MongoDB data base on the back end. The application allows the user to sign up, login, search for remote jobs on the job board (Those are real jobs coming from an API), save and delete their favorite jobs. This application also follows the MVC model.
